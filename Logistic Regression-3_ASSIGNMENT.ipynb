    "\n",
    "1. Problem Definition:\n",
    "Identify Objectives: Clearly define the problem you want to solve, including what classes you need to predict.\n",
    "Understand Requirements: Determine the business objectives and how the model's predictions will be used.\n",
    "2. Data Collection:\n",
    "Gather Data: Collect data relevant to your classification task. This may include structured data, text, images, etc.\n",
    "Ensure Diversity: Make sure your dataset includes sufficient examples from each class to avoid class imbalance.\n",
    "3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand its characteristics, distributions, and relationships among features.\n",
    "Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.\n",
    "Feature Selection/Engineering: Select relevant features and possibly create new features that might improve model performance.\n",
    "4. Data Splitting:\n",
    "Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Common splits include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.\n",
    "Stratified Sampling: Ensure that each subset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset, particularly important in multiclass settings.\n",
    "5. Model Selection:\n",
    "Choose Algorithms: Select appropriate algorithms for multiclass classification, such as Logistic Regression (with Softmax), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.\n",
    "Baseline Model: Start with a simple model to establish a baseline performance for comparison.\n",
    "6. Model Training:\n",
    "Train the Model: Use the training dataset to fit the model. This involves selecting hyperparameters and using training data to learn the decision boundaries.\n",
    "Monitor Performance: Track metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score during training, especially on the validation set.\n",
    "7. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "Evaluate on Validation Set: Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.\n",
